# Curve-Fitting
A C++ mini project that performs curve fitting using the Least Squares Method. It calculates the best-fit line equation y=a+bxy = a + bxy=a+bx for given data points, minimizing error between actual and predicted values. Useful for data analysis, trend prediction, and regression modeling.
